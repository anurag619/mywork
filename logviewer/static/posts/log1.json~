Jul 15 19:35:15 *	Soumya (n=chatzill@117.192.4.244) has joined #dgplug
Jul 15 19:35:23 <kushal>	stack is data structure where data comes in from one, and goes out from that same side
Jul 15 19:35:25 <kushal>	like
Jul 15 19:35:30 <kushal>	if we have 
Jul 15 19:35:37 <kushal>	[1,2,3]as alist 
Jul 15 19:36:31 <kushal>	then if we add another data in stack (which is known as push)
Jul 15 19:36:43 <kushal>	a = [1,2,3]
Jul 15 19:36:48 <kushal>	a.append(5)
Jul 15 19:36:55 <kushal>	now a becomes
Jul 15 19:36:59 <kushal>	[1,2,3,5]
Jul 15 19:37:03 *	Prakhar (n=prakhar@122.163.69.147) has joined #dgplug
Jul 15 19:37:25 <kushal>	so if we take out the data from it , which value should go out first ?  5
Jul 15 19:37:34 <kushal>	^^ this operation is known as pop
Jul 15 19:37:39 <kushal>	a.pop()
Jul 15 19:37:50 <kushal>	which will return 5 out of a
Jul 15 19:38:01 <kushal>	^^ now try this with different data as you wish 
Jul 15 19:38:57 <rtnpro>	done
Jul 15 19:39:07 <KishanGoyal>	ya...done
Jul 15 19:39:20 <KishanGoyal>	working fine
Jul 15 19:39:30 <kushal>	try with strings , and other data
